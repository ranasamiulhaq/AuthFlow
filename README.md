# AuthFlow
This project is a full-stack authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The frontend is powered by Vite for a fast and efficient development experience. It provides a complete solution for user authentication, including secure password handling, token-based sessions, and third-party login with Google.
